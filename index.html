        <p>
            Girl, you got me shook from the way your body looks<br>
            Got me writing hooks, got me feeling like a rook <br>
            I don't do it by the book but for you I'll take a look <br>
            Don't know what your momma took, sweet and spicy like a cook, yeah
        </p>
        <p>
            I'll keep it real, let's make a deal <br>
            Buy you a meal, if you just let me feel <br>
            Get out your heels, grab on the wheel <br>
            Back to my place at the top of the hill <br>
            Don't have regrets, I know what's next <br>
            She need to fresh up, be back in a sec <br>
            Look at them legs, don't make me beg <br>
            Back to the room, let me show you my bed, yeah
        </p>
        <p class="chorus">
            Touching on your body feels like taking on a drug <br>
            You got me feeling good, yeah, you got me feeling numb <br>
            Everything you do, I can't seem to get enough <br>
            You got me feeling good, yeah, you got me feeling numb <br>
            Touching on your body feels like taking on a drug <br>
            You got me feeling good, yeah, you got me feeling numb <br>
            Everything you do, I can't seem to get enough <br>
            You got me feeling good, yeah, you got me feeling numb
        </p>
        <p>
            I could look at you all day, watch the way them hips sway <br>
            Love your body so I pray, don't you dare take it away <br>
            Can't control what I say, lost my mind 'cause your frame <br>
            Hey girl, what's your name? Lit me up just like a flame
        </p>
        <p>
            Body in motion, I feel the commotion <br>
            Be on you like lotion, I'm honest and broken <br>
            I flow like the ocean, I feel you were chosen <br>
            To fix me I'm open, my heart that you stolen, ay <br>
            Stay with me, play with me, lay with me <br>
            Hate to see when you leave, chemistry feels like it's destiny <br>
            I just want you laying next to me <br>
            And I really don't want you to ever leave
        </p>
